# ML Exercise
MNIST Classifier and visualizations for consideration for Dr. Hanocka's research group, 3DL.

## Description

MNIST Classifier uses LeNet architecture to decipher hand-drawn numbers from the MNIST database. The MNIST database is comprised of 10,000 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images that are evenly distributed across numbers 0-9. The classifier can be trained to greater than 95% accuracy in around a minute, and to greater than 99% accuracy in several minutes.

Greater details & visualizations can be found in the pptx or [here] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12GSWAh5ezFS7bwjfwteNPCxCsWunBPsU2vkFKQbb3ug/edit?usp=sharing)

## Dependencies

This classifer was implemented using pytorch.
